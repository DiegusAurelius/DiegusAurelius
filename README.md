# Diegus Aurelius

💀 At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: I have to go to work — as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm? –Marcus Aurelius

🍣 Once you decide on your occupation, you must immerse yourself in your work. You have to fall in love with your work. Never complain about your job. You must dedicate your life to mastering your skill. That's the secret of success and is the key to being regarded honorably. –Jiro Ono

🦋 The butterfly's life cycle, from caterpillar to winged adult, symbolizes personal growth and transformation. It reminds wearers of their capacity for change and emerging stronger from life's challenges.
