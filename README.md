# Diegus Aurelius

`web developer`

> At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work — as a web developer. What do I have to complain of, if I’m going to do what I was born for — the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?"

> The magic you're looking for is in the work you're avoiding.

> When you're in bed, you're dead.
