# Diegus Aurelius

💀 Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years. Death stands at your elbow. Be good for something while you live and it is in your power. –Marcus Aurelius

🍣 Once you decide on your occupation, you must immerse yourself in your work. You have to fall in love with your work. Never complain about your job. You must dedicate your life to mastering your skill. That's the secret of success and is the key to being regarded honorably. –Jiro Ono
